    <p>Last year, out of curiosity I decided to check out the book Launch a Kickass T-Shirt Brand. I decided to give it a shot and that summer I set up a booth in Puerto Rico Comic Con selling t-shirts and stickers I designed. I also had a basic website and social media campaign promoting the products. My expectations with the brand weren’t in line with the reality. I wanted to be completely sold out of my product by the end of Comic Con, instead I was able to sell a quarter of my merchandise. I learned from the experience that I didn’t want to get into the t-shirt business, however it was because of this project I first started becoming interested in web design, collaborating with a programmer friend of mine in making the website. In designing the website I started reading up on responsive web design and usability and in the process became interested in user experience.</p>

<p>And yes, I’m still sitting on about a hundred t-shirts.</p>
