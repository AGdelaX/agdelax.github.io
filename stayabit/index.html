            <p class="bold-text">Stayabit Token Sale</p>
            <p class="big-body-text main-text">We came up with the idea of the Stayabit token after our CTO began working with Solidity on the Ethereum blockhain. We saw an enormous potential in issuing a utility token that can be used by token holders in the following ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Payment</li>
                    <li>Booking Priority</li>
                    <li>Collateral</li>
                    <li>Discounts</li>
                    <li>Voting</li>
                    <li>Membership Club</li>
                    <li>Credit Scoring</li>
                </ol>
            <p class="big-body-text main-text">These uses would not just be enormously beneficial to our business, there was potential that this could be the de-facto utility token for the entire furnished apartment rental industry&mdash;a market with yearly revenues upwards of $170bn.</p>
            <p class="big-body-text main-text">Naming this token the Stayabit, we went to work. Our CTO worked on implementing the smart contracts while I collaborated with the marketing team to define the look of the brand while simultaneously developing and designing our token sale landing page.</p>

            <p class="big-body-text main-text">Once the sale goes live, we needed a way for potential buyers to understand what state the sale is in. We were unique in that there'd be discounts depending on how many were sold&mdash;where the earlier you buy in the sale, the better the discount tier you can potentially be in. I designed a scaling bar graph that visually represented these tiers, as well as developed its responsiveness on mobile devices.</p>

        <div class="images-box">
        <p class="big-body-text main-text">I designed a 'checkout' flow where customers fill in their information before being taken to the wallet link, with these screens taking place in the top portion of the website, rather than using a modal or taking users to a brand-new page. This was done to keep customers in the context of the sale&mdash;if during their checkout process they wanted to look into a certain detail about the sale they'd just have to scroll down rather than exiting a modal or going back to the previous page.</p>

        <p class="big-body-text main-text">It was important for us to give back to the cryptocommunity and engage with the audience, so we created a Medium publication called <a href="https://medium.com/stayawhile-presents-faces-of-crypto" class="hyperlink">Faces of Crypto</a> where we interviewed several cryptoenthusiasts and the impact cryptocurrencies had made on their lives.</p>

        <p class="big-body-text main-text">Due to the exposure of several vulnearabilities in the Solidity language, we were forced to delay our launch for the sake of user security.</p>
